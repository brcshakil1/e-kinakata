# Express Application

This is a simple Express application with error handling and a route for testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
- You have a basic understanding of TypeScript (optional, as the project is in TypeScript).

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Compile the TypeScript files:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the application:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Development

If you want to run the application in development mode with automatic recompilation, you can use:

```sh
npm run dev
```
